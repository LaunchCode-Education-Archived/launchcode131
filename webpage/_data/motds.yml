- "If you would like us to consider a grade change for your midterm exam, please follow these steps: (1) Author a note that explains what you believe the grading mistake was (including whatever supporting arguments you think would be helpful to your cause).  Make sure to be clear what portion(s) of the exam are being discussed, and how many points are in play.
(2) Make sure your name is on the note.
(3) Attach the note to the front of your exam.
(4) Place both the note and your exam in Prof. Chamberlain√¢s box in Bryan 509 (the department office).

Be aware that when we are doing regrades, it is completely fair game for us to look at the entire exam, not just the portion that you identify.  (I.e., if something else is wrong, you don't get a pass just because we didn't see it the first time.)"
