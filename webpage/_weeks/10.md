This week we use a pulse-oximeter to explore our own heartrate.
Getting excited?  Your numbers will go up!

Also, you will start to design and implement your own health monitor,
complete with pulse monitor and pedometer.
It will interface with Java to create graphs and present a simplified
interface on the Arduino itself.
