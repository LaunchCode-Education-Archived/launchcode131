If necessary, review **[studio procedures](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~jp/cse131/)** before
starting.

### Warmup

Thanks to Emily Feng for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4"> this link </a> to a Ted Talk about flag design.

<H4>Overview</H4>
In honor of the upcoming <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/unday/">UN Day</a>, you will select (or design) a flag of your choice and create that flag using the drawing methods available in Sedgewick's library.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here is the one I created:

But I am certain you will be much more creative!

<H4>Resources</H4>
You may find the following resources helpful for this studio:
<UL>
  <LI> <a href="../../slides/15inout.pptx">Slides</a> from lecture. (Also
available in <a href="../../slides/15inout.pdf"> PDF</a>)
  <LI> Lecture code that you will find in your (studio and personal) repositories,
in the <KBD>lecture</KBD> source folder, in the <KBD>mod4sect1</KBD>
and <KBD>mod4sect2</KBD>
packages.
  <LI> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>
for <KBD><a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html">StdDraw</a></KBD>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Warning</B> The book is missing some of the functionality that is in
the Sedgewick library.  For example, the book is missing the method that
draws a filled rectangle, and that can be useful for drawing a flag.
<p>
See the link above for the full range of possibilities.

<H4>Procedure</H4>
<DL>
<DT> Design your country
<DD>
<UL>
 <LI> What are the founding principles of your country?
 <LI> What is your country's motto?
 <LI> What major exports do you envision for your country?
 <LI> Who might be valuable allies for your country?
 <LI> Does your country have its own
<UL>
 <LI> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_birds"> national bird</a> ,
 <LI> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floral_emblem"> floral emblem</a>, or
 <LI> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_emblem"> national emblem</a>?
</UL>
</UL>
Thinking through these questions may help guide the design of your country's flag
and anthem.
<p>
<DT> Design your flag
<DD>
<OL>
  <LI> Visit the <a href="http://flagpedia.net/">Flags of all Countries</a> web site, and decide on a flag that your
studio group would like to create for this studio.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Design (or pick) a flag that has at least 3 shapes on it.  If you need to approximate something by a standard shape,
such as a maple leaf by a circle, that's fine:  just claim
that your flag is somewhat <I>abstract</I>.
<p>
If you want to <B>design your own flag</B>, that's fine.  Make sure it has at least 3 shapes in it.  Try to come up with
a cool name for your flag's country.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> Open the <KBD>studio4</KBD> package int he <KBD>studios</KBD> source folder, and open the <KBD>Flag</KBD> class.
     <UL>
       <LI> That class is currently empty except for the <KBD>main</KBD>.
       <LI> Insert code that creates the flag of your choice.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Notes:
<UL>
  <LI> Most of the drawing methods want the <I>center</I> of the object to be drawn, along with a radius, or a half-width, or a half-height.   Be aware of this!
  <LI> If you want colors, they are already in the Sedgewick libraries.  If you start to type something like:
<PRE>
sedgewick.
</PRE>
then eclipse will fill in possiblities after the <KBD>.</KBD> which will include the colors at the top of that list.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
       <LI> Frame your flag by surrounding it by a black rectangle of substantial thickness, (unfilled).
       <LI> When done, allow your studio neighbors and TAs to admire its beauty.
     </UL>
</OL>
<DT> Display the name of your country
<DD>
<OL>
 <LI> In the center of your flag, using a color that allows the text to stand out, write the name of your country
on top of your flag.
 <LI> In a (literally) moving display of patriotism, arrange for your program to print the name of your country
repeatedly, from the upper-left-hand corner to the lower-right-hand corner.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For more drama, pause for a bit between each printing of the country's name, to allow for cheering from the crowd.
Take a look at the <KBD><a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html#show(int)">show(int t)</a></KBD> method to achieve the pause.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL>
<DT> Compose an anthem for your flag
<DD>
<OL>
  <LI> Find the <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD> program in the <KBD>book</KBD> source folder, in the <KBD>book.ch1</KBD> package.
  <LI> Run the program and make sure you can hear some sound when you play a given piece.
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The music inputs come from the <KBD>music</KBD> folder in your workspace.  The program lets you choose
    any of the files in that directory, or you can navigate elsewhere if you wish.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <LI> Based on what you see in the <KBD>Ascale.txt</KBD> file, design a piece that is your own anthem by specifying
     the pitches and durations.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can do this by modifying an existing file in the <KBD>music</KBD> folder (for example, there is already
a <KBD>National_Anthem.txt</KBD> file, so you can just modify that), or you can create
a new text file in that same folder and place your composition there.
<p>
If you are really unclear how to do this, no problem, you can just use one of the existing compositions.
<p>
Or, you could generate tones and durations randomly.  Pick values that seem
similar to what you see in the music files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
   <LI> Try <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD> and select your composition for playing.
   <LI> Once you like it, copy and paste the appropriate code from <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD> into your <KBD>Flag</KBD> program so the anthem plays after your flag and text are drawn.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI> The code you want is everything inside the <KBD>main</KBD> method;  get help if necessary.
<LI> When you run your code, you will have to select the anthem by hand.
<LI>
If you want the file to open without the user having to choose it, then replace the
line
<PRE>
ArgsProcessor.useStdInput("music");
</PRE>
with
<PRE>
System.setIn(new FileInputStream("music/National_Anthem.txt"));
</PRE>
Eclipse will provide guidance about importing the right classes so this will work.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> See if you can figure out how to get your anthem to play repeatedly.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This may not seem easy, but it builds on what you know about arrays and
iteration.
