If necessary, review [studio procedures] (.../.../StudioDocs/studioheader.html "Studio Procedures") before starting.

###Warmup(s)

* First, form a group:

  * If you are at a table with a large, wall-mounted screens, a group of 3-4 people is fine.
  * If you are seated at a table without a large screen, a group of 2 people is better.

* All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work.
* All members of the group should update their repositories:

  * Open your repository in eclipse
  * Right-click (control-click on a mac) on your repository name
  * Drag down to `Team..`
  * Choose `Update`
  * Supply your WUSTL key and password as necessary

* Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
* Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard. Before doing so, **commit your work** to make sure your work is saved.

###Dice Simulation
In this studio you will simulate the throw of a number of [Dice] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice "Dice Wiki"). This will require using what you have learned in [Module 2] (.../.../Modules/2/ "Module 2") and [Module 1] (/.../.../Modules/1/ "Module 1") but will also require the use of *arrays* as taught in [this module] (/.../.../Modules/3/ "Module 3").

We ask that you follow these instructions carefully, step-by-step, so as to develop your code by concept refinement. Each concept is first described, and then your group takes steps to implement the concept.
Ask questions as needed to complete one step before going on to the next.

####Procedures

In the steps described below, pictures are shown of dice to illustrate the concepts involved in this studio. You will not really be using or displaying the pictures. Instead, your program will *simulate* throwing dice and you will measure the properties of interest.

1. You need two pieces of information from the user:

  1. **How many dice will be used in this simulation?**

    * For the purposes of this document, let us say that *D* dice are used.
    * As an example, if *D* is 3, then a given throw could be:
