You will calculate the fine one would have to pay for going over the speed limit in the state of Massachusetts
according to the [Massachusetts DMV](http://www.dmv.org/ma-massachusetts/traffic-tickets.php).

> By completing this work, you  demonstrate that you can:

>  * Create a Java class on your own
>
>  * Arrange for the class to take inputs of interest
>
>  * Compute output values of interest
>
>  * Produce meaningful output based on your computations

Have you ever received a ticket for speeding? 
If so, how do you feel about it? Were you going more or less than 10 miles over the speed limit? 
The objective of this extension is not only to allow you to practice **assignment statements** and **data types** but also for you to create a
practical tool, though of course we hope you never need to compute a speeding
fine for yourself.

Consider the following story: 

* Pat is driving a Mini Cooper at 85 MPH on a 
road that has the speed limit of 60 MPH.
* Pat is therefore going 25 MPH over the speed limit.
* If Pat is caught speeding, what would be Pat's fine?  

	For this assignment, we model the fine after Massachusetts law:

	* A fine is assessed only if the driver's speed is at least 10 MPH over
	the speed limit.
	
	* For the first 10 MPH over the speed limit, the fine is $50 no matter what
	
	* For any additional MPH past the first ten, $10 are added to the fine

	* Thus, Pat owes $50 for going at least 10 MPH over the speed limit
	(60+10=70 MPH).  To this, we add
	$10 \* 15 = $150 for the additional 15 MPH.  Thus, Pat owes $200.
 
##Procedure
1. First, create a **SpeedLimit** Java class in the
**speeding** package of the **extensions** source folder.

	>Do this by 
	> * right (control) clicking on the **speeding** package,
	and then 
	>
	> * chooose **New**&hellip;**Class**
	>
	> * Type in the name of the class (**SpeedLimit**)
	>
	> * **Be sure** to check the box so that **public static void main** is included
	>
	> * Click OK

* Write code to prompt the user for the information you need to
compute the fine, assuming the fine is computed as described above.


	> * Consider and decide upon the **data type** to represent information
	>of interest to this problem.
	>
	>* You must ask the user for some input values. If you do not
	>recall how to use **ArgsProcessor**, review the video entitled *Prompting the user for input values*.


* Arrange for your program to produce output such that:

	* For the first 10 miles over the speed limit, the fine is 50 no matter what
	
	* For any additional mile past the first ten, 10 dollars are added to the fine

	> Beware: Make sure your program works for 0 MPH and all possible
	> positive velocities.



* Finally, your program should print how many miles you were going over the speed limit and how much money the fine will be.

Sample output based on the example story above:

```
You reported a speed of 85 MPH for a speed limit of 60 MPH.
You went 25 MPH over the speed limit.
Your fine is $200.
```

>You must compute the required information **without** using **if** statements.  To evaluate an expression conditionaly, use the
> [ternary](http://alvinalexander.com/java/edu/pj/pj010018) operator,
> an example of which follows:
> 
> `int x = (y > 7) ? 12 : 5;`
>
>The variable **x** is set to **12** if **y**'s value
>is greater than **7**;  otherwise **x** is set to **5**.

##Background

###Pixels

The word *pixel* stands for Picture Element. A pixel is a small part
of a picture. Pixels are the little dots that make up LCD
screens. When you see a low-resolution picture that is grainy, the
grain you're seeing are the pixels.

###Representing color in Java

Pixels are made up of 3 colors: red, green, and blue (hence the
term *RGB*). The color of a pixel is made up of a combination of the
*intensities* of each of red, green, and blue components. Intensities range from 0 (meaning none of that color is present) to 255
(meaning as much as possible of that color is present). You
declare a new pixel by coding 

```
new Color(redValue, greenValue,blueValue)
```

where **redValue** is the intensity (an integer between 0 and 255) of 
red, **greenValue** is the intensity of green, and **blueValue** is the intensity of blue.<br>


For example, you get the color black with **new&nbsp;Color&nbsp;(0,0,0)** (0
intensity for all colors). You get red with **new&nbsp;Color&nbsp;(255,0,0)**
(highest intesity for red, 0 intensity for green and blue).

###Filters

This work involves writing a number of filters that are applied to
images to achieve a given result.  There are two kinds of methods that
you complete, and each is described below:

`**int foo(int pixelComponent)**`

Methods with the above signature take in a single pixel component
intensity value:  an integer between 0 and 255 inclusively.
They are obligated to return an intensity value as their result.

These methods are used by the course software as shown below:

![Color Intensity](../../../extensions/colorintensity.jpg)
{: style="text-align: center"}

1. A **Color** object is broken into its red, green, and blue
components.

2. Each component is passed to your **foo** method, and the
result of that function is retained.

3. The three results are combined into a new **Color** object.

In other words, the **foo** function is used as a filter on each
of a **Color**'s components.  The **foo** function is unaware
of which component it is processing:  it treats each equally.

`**Color bar(Color c)**`

Methods with the above signature accept and produce a standard Java
**[Color](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)** object.  These methods can themselves decompose a **Color**
object into its components and create a resulting **Color** object
to achieve whatever effect is desired.
 
##Project: Image Processing Methods

1. In Eclipse, open the **extensions** source folder and
then open the **imageprocessor** package. Find and open the
**ImageProcessor** class.

	> This is the *main* program you run to see the results of your work.
	> 
	> Go ahead and run it as a Java application.
	> You should see a window pop up with
	> some images preloaded.

	
2. Try the *darker* filter.  It has been implemented for you, and
it should produce an image in the *Target* window that resembles
the image in the *source1* window, but is a bit darker.

3. Try the *combine* filter.  It has also been implemented but
its effects may seem a bit strange.  You will soon implement a smarter version
of this kind of a filter.

4. The other methods are not yet implemented, but you are free to try
them.

	> By the way, you can drag images between the icon panel at the top and the working
	> panels in the middle, or *vice versa*, so that you can manipulate
	> other images than the ones that are preloaded.<p>
	> You can also load your own images by clicking on the icon that resembles
	> a *plus* sign.

##Directions:
First, right click on the **ImageProcessorTest** class, and **Run As** a **JUnit Test**.

> * On the left you should see a whole bunch of 
> test names with red or blue x's by them, indicating that they are not being passed. * Every time you complete a piece of code correctly, one of the tests will pass, 
> and a small green x will appear beside it. 
>
> * Once all of the tests pass, a satisfying green bar will appear in place of the red one that you see now. You will 
> not get this green bar in this extension, though, because you will not be doing any work on the **bgSubtract** or **bdReplace** methods. 
> To get the green bar you must go on to the next extension.

Now open the **Filters** class and begin your work as described
below.  

> It is strongly suggested that you re-run the unit test, and run **ImageProcessor** to test each filter after its
> completion before you move on to the next filter.  This will ensure that you are making progress and not going down a wrong path.

Complete the provided stub
methods as described below.
In the method bodies, **use mathematical expressions**. Do *not* use
a conditional (if) statement.

###Intensity filters

> Use **no conditional execution** for this part:  only arithmetic expressions
> as you have learned them in Module 1.

1. Complete the method called *copy*, so that each
provided intensity value is copied exactly
from the source to the target panel.

	>Hint: This is a *very* simple method.

	![](../../../extensions/copy.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
      
2. Complete the method that will *composite* the images
in the
two source panels by averaging their components. This method accepts two
parameters, which are color components from the two source panels.

	![](../../../extensions/composite.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
3. Complete the method called *negative* that will
produce the
negative image by inverting the intensity of each component. 

	>For
	>example, if the parameter value is 0, you should return 255. If the
	>parameter value is 1, you should return 254, and so on.

	![](../../../extensions/negative.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}

4. Complete the method *posterize* that will reduce the
number of possible colors in an image. For a given color component, your
method will choose between
two intensities, 0 or 255, which correspond to that color component
being turned off or on completely. 
So, since each color has three
components (red, green, and blue), you will end up with an image that
has only 8 different colors. 

	> Remember that you are *not*
	> allowed to use conditionals (if) statements for this part of the lab.
	> 
	> *Hint:* : Recall that color components
	> are in the range 0-255. Also, recall that if you divide an int by
	> another int, the result number will be truncated. For example, 
	> **130 / 128 =& 1**, but 
	> **125 / 128 =& 0**.


	![](../../../extensions/posterize.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}


###**Color** filters

Note that each pixel
of an image is represented as a [Color](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)
object.

> * Continue to
> use **no conditional execution** for this part:  only arithmetic expressions
> as you have learned them in Module 1.
> * To create a new **Color**, you must specify its red, green, and blue components in that order.  For example
> 
> `Color c = new Color(25,128,0);`
> 
> declares **c** to be a color with some red (25 out of 255), half of the possible green, and no blue.
> * If you have a **Color c**, then you can get its red, green, and blue components as follows:
>
> `int red   = c.getRed();`
> `int green = c.getGreen();`
> `int blue  = c.getBlue();`

Create and test methods (whose parameters and return values are <code>Color</code>s)
with the following specifications.

1. Complete the method *brighter* that will return, for
each pixel, a Color that is brighter than
the original. 

	> The 
	> **[Color](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)**
	> class makes this easy because it already
	> provides a 
	> **<a href="">[brighter\(\)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html#brighter%28%29)**
	> method that returns a brighter color.
	>
	> If **c** is a color, then **c.brighter()** is a brighter version of **c**'s color.


	![](../../../extensions/brighter.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
2. Complete the method *grayscale* that will make a
grayscale image from a color image.
To do this, you will take in one Color parameter (the Color object for
a pixel from the original image) and
will produce a new Color in which all the components (red, green, and
blue) have the same value.

	> Hint: To choose which value, average the three components of the
	> original color.

	![](../../../extensions/grayscale.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
  
###More **Color** filters

OK, now you can use **if** statements!


1. Complete the method *blackAndWhite* that produces a
black and white image by returning, for each pixel, a **Color** that is
either black or white, depending upon the overall intensity of the
original color. 

	For your return value, use the constant **Color.BLACK**
	or **Color.WHITE**. It's up to you how to decide when a
	color's components, taken as a whole, should be considered black or
	white.

	![](../../../extensions/blackandwhite.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
2. Complete the method *combineBrighter* that combines
two images by choosing for each pixel the color from the image that has
the brighter pixel in that location. To determine which pixel is
brighter, compare the sums of the red, green, and blue components of
the two pixels. Since the ProcessorTool will run your method for every
pair of pixels, the resulting image will have some pixels from the
first image and some from the second image.

This is a continuation of the previous extension.  It is therefore
suggested that you
do the previous extension first.

##Directions:

The main program you should run for this extension is **Background**, which
conveniently
sets up the images in the bar and panels for you to do this work.

So run **Background** as a Java application.  You will see two
similar images in the source panels, and some other images in the image
bar.

Open the **Filters** class and begin your work as described
below.  

###Two more **Color** filters

> You can use **if** statements for this work.

1. Complete the method *bgSubtract* so that it returns a **Color** as follows:

	* If the **source1Color** and **source2Color** colors are
	*sufficiently similar*, return **Color.BLUE**. The idea is to subtract
	the background so that what is common between the two source images is shown
	in blue.

		We will define a new term for this lab, the *Saturation Tolerance*. What this tells us is how different two colors can be, and still be considered 
		*sufficiently similar*. For instance; if the *Saturation Tolerance* is 10, one color has a red value of 130, and another color has a 
		red value of 138, these would be considered *sufficiently similar*. But if one color had a red value of 35 and another had a red value of 50, they would not 
		be considered *sufficiently similar*

	* Otherwise, return **source1Color**.

	An example is shown below:

	![](../../../extensions/bg1.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
	Where the two images are similar, the corresponding pixel in the
	target image is blue, because your method returned **Color.BLUE**.
	Where the images differ, the first image is shown in the target,
	because your method returned the pixel color from the first image.

2. Complete the method *bgReplace* that functions as
follows:

	* If the **source1Color** is **Color.BLUE**, then return
	the **source2Color**.
	* Otherwise, return **source1Color**.

	The effect of this filter is to replace the blue color from the first image
	with the corresponding pixels from the second image.

	To see this work, perform the following steps:

	1. Drag the blue-screen image from the target panel and drop it into the leftmost source panel.  The GUI should replace what was there with the blue-screen
	image. 
	
	2. Drag the other two-bear picture (the reverse of the one shown in the
	source panel) from the top icon bar into the middle source panel.

		After dragging these images around the GUI, the results should resemble the
		following:

		> **Note:**  No transformation is applied yet.  The *copy* operation appears
		> as the menu choice but the *Go* button was not pressed.

		![](../../../extensions/bg2.png)
		{: style="text-align: center"}
	
	3. Now apply the *bgReplace* filter, and the results resemble the
	following:

		![](../../../extensions/bg3.png)
		{: style="text-align: center"}

	4. For fun, drag the chicken image from the top icon bar into the middle source panel, and reapply the * bgReplace* filter.  The results should
	resemble the following:

		![](../../../extensions/bg4.png)
		{: style="text-align: center"}
	
		The chicken is a smaller image, so it did not take up the entire size of
		the bear image.
