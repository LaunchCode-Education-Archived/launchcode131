# Extension 1: Divine Lines:
Authors

: [Ron K. Cytron](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/)
: Ken Goldman

A video demonstrating a solution can be found [here](../../../extensions/lines.mp4)

In the `extensions` source folder, find and open the `lines` package and the
`Lines` class contained therein.    The `main` method is provided, and it calls
the method `drawLine`,which you must complete.

Do not change the parameters or return type of the `drawLine` method!  You are welcome to define
*other* methods in the `Lines` class if you wish, but the `drawLine` method's signature (the number and types of its parameters and its return type) must
be preserved as you do your work.

Your task is to devise an algorithm for drawing a line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) using *recursion*.
It may take you some time to think about how to do that, but once you see the recursive nature of drawing a line,
you will probably need only a few lines of code to accomplish this task.


Please take note of the following guidelines, as you will not receive credit unless your solution follows
the rules of this assignment:

* The code given to you will perform a test of your `drawLine` when you run it as a Java Application.

* If you want to draw lines interactively using your solution, then run the `InteractiveLines` class
	as a Java Application.
	
* Do not use `StdDraw.line` to do any of your work!

* The only methods you are allowed to use from `StdDraw` are `point`,
	`setPenRadius`, and `setPenColor`.

	> This means you must draw your line one point at a time.

* Some students approach this problem by computing the slope of the line and
	then incrementally trying to draw pieces of it using recursion. That approach
	comes to grief for vertical lines, which have infinite slope.  There
	is a much easier and satisfying way to solve this problem, but you have
	to think about it.

	Do **not** compute or use the slope of the line in your approach.  We will
	not count the extension if you do that.  Instead, think recursively about
	how a line is constructed.

 When you are done it should look like this:

#Extension 2: Persian Recursian:
Authors

: [Ron K. Cytron](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/)
: The idea for this assignment comes from the article &quot;Persian Recursion&quot; by Anne M. Burns that appeared on pages 196-199 of *Mathematics Magazine*, volume 7, in 1997


* A video demonstrating my solution can be found [here](../../../extensions/persian.mp4).

* That video instructs you how to speed up the drawing substantially.

* Don't speed things up until you see the rug is drawing properly.

In the `extensions` folder open the `recursivepatterns` package and
the `PersianRug` class.
Your task is to complete the method `persianRug` so that it draws a rug similar to the
one shown below:

![](../../../extensions/rug.png)

Each call to `persianRug` works on a given square of the rug.   Consider the picture shown below:

![](../../../extensions/orig.png)


* The square is described by its lower-left corner (in this case, (0,0)), and its size (in this case, 1).

* Each step of the recursion considers the colors of the provided square's sides (in this case, blue), and computes
	a color for the two lines to be drawn inside the square (in this case, red).  

	Computing the color of these two lines is what makes the rug look as it does.  More detail is given below
	concerning how to pick a color.

* Further recursion would act on the sub-squares you see in the above picture.  For example, the upper-left
	subsquare has its lower-left corner at (0, 0.5), has size 0.5, and has colors blue, red, red, blue, starting from
	north and proceeding clockwise.

The parameters for `persianRug` are documented in the source code provided to you for this extension.

Notes:

* Colors in this lab are represented as an index into a `Color` array called `palette`.  This
	array is provided for you in the source code and it is passed into your
	`persianRug` method.
	
* Indexes into `palette` are passed into `persianRug` to describe the colors of the
square's bordering edges.  For example, blue is represented by index 0 into the `palette` array,
and cyan appears at index 1.

* Picking a color for the two lines drawn inside a given square is the *creative* aspect of this
assignment.  The following should be read carefully and understood before you jump into coding.

	* Although you will eventually pick more diverse colors, we recommend that unti your lab is working,
	you should always use color index 0 for the color of the two drawn lines.

	* Once that is working, you must pick a color that is a function of the square's bordering colors (which
	are conveniently represented as indexes into `palette`.   That function must have the following
	properties to perform correctly:

* The function must return a value that is an appropriate index into the `palette` array.

	As you know, 0 is the smallest index, and the largest index is `palette.length-1`.

* The function must return the same value for any permutation of a given square's bordering colors.
	For example, if the colors are specified in order red, blue, blue, red, then any square with two blue and two 
	red sides must compute the same color for the two drawn lines.

	Recall that these colors are represented as integers, each being an index into the `palette` array.
	What kinds of functions on integers return the same result no matter the order of those integers?


* Different functions will produce different rugs.  The rug below is computed using the same code as the rug shown at the top of this assignment, but the function was tweaked slightly:

	![](../../../extensions/otherrug.png)
	Perhaps you can see that in the above rug, once a square has red on each of its borders, the two drawn lines inside that square are also red.
	That effect just happens to be a property of the function I used to produce
	the above image.

# Extension 3: Flower Power:

Authors

: [Ron K. Cytron](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/)
: Ken Goldman

> A video demonstrating my solution can be found [here](../../../extensions/flower.mp4).

In the `extensions` folder open the `recursivepatterns` package.  
The following classes found there, and described in greater detail below, must
be completed for this extension:

* `TransparentColor` 

* `Flower`

The ultimate goal is to complete the `flower` method of the
`Flower` class so that it draws an image similar to the one
shown below:

![](../../../extensions/flower.png)

The colors shown in the above image are somewhat *transparent*, so that
the color of an ellipse is allowed to bleed through the ellipse above it.

You can proceed by working on either class first.  However, if you postpone
`TransparentColor`, you will see solid colors in your flower until
you have completed that class.

##Details

`TransparentColor`

: As is the case with most color models, Java's 
	[Color](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html) 
	objects
	are allowed to have a degree of transparency.

	The `transparentColor` method, as provided to you, ignores the
	`alpha` parameter and returns the color provided as input.

	You must change this behavior so that the color returned as the same
	red, green, and blue components as the provided color, but with the
	specified transparency.

	Java makes this easy, because there is a constructor for
	[Color](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html) 
	that does the job.
	This task is given to you primarily to acquaint you with the process of looking
	through JavaDoc documentation to find a class or method you need.

	Follow the instructions provided in the `TransparentColor` source code.

	Before moving on, test your code by running `TransparentColor` as
	a Java Application.  You should see the colors solid at the upper right of
	the drawing window, and blended (more transparent) at the lower left.


`Flower`

: Your task here is to complete the `flower` method, whose parameters
	are described in the JavaDoc for the method.  Some useful guildines follow:

	* The `StdDraw` class offers a `filledEllipse` method,
		but you must set the color before calling it.
	* You should choose a random color for each ellipse you draw, and you are
		provided a `palette` of `Color` objects as input to
		your `flower` method.

		If necessary, review the material in the text and slides that discusses how
		to pick a random integer.  You would use that integer to index the
		`palette` array.

	* You must find the substructure in the flower pattern.  To help
		with this, the following
		diagram shows the locations of each ellipse within a given level of recursion:

	![](../../../extensions/five-recursive-calls.jpg)

	* Analyze the above diagrams to infer the area taken up by each sub-ellipse
		that you must draw.

	* Remember that the `StdDraw` coordinate system has (0,0) at the 
		lower-left, and (1,1) at the upper right.

	* Remember that `StdDraw` shapes take a center as their primary
		coordinate, and use half-widths and half-lengths for dimensions.

As usual, ask for help as needed.

#Extension 4: Fibonacci Recursively and Iteratively:

Authors

: [Ron K. Cytron](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/)

## Introduction

You have written the recursive function for the
[Fibonacci Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in studio.  In this extension, you will
compare the running time of that recursive formulation with an
iterative formulation of the same function.

## Procedure

*  Find the `fibonacci` package in the `extensions`
	source folder.

* Complete the `recursive` method so that it returns the
	*n*<SUP>th</SUP> fibonacci number using the recursive proram
	from <a href="studio.html">studio</a>.

* Complete the `iterative` method so that it computes the
	same function, but iteratively.

	As a hint, you will need two variables that represent the 
	*(n-1)*<SUP>th</SUP> and
	*(n-2)*<SUP>th</SUP> values of the sequence.  Adding those together
	produces the
	*n*<SUP>th</SUP> term.  The variables' values are then shifted prior
	to the next iteration.

* Run the `CorrectnessTest` to make sure your functions are
	computing the correct values.

* We will now compare the timing of the two methods.
	First run `TimedTest`, and give it a little time to finish. Right click the `outputs` folder and click refresh. You should now see two excel file outputs in the folder. Open them up and plot the points, observing the difference in time between the iterative and recursive methods.
