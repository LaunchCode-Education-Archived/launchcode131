#Review Course Policies

We meet twice a week. **Mondays** will be the due dates for homework assignments. We will also use Mondays to go over past exercises and/or homework assignments.

**Thursdays** will begin with a concept review for the current module. You will then be asked to complete that week's **studio**. A studio is a short problem set that we expect you to complete in class. We do not "grade" them per se, you simply have to show up and try your best. Even if you do not complete a studio before the end of class, you will still get credit for it.

You will be expected to keep up with the prep work for each module. You should do the prep work before showing up to class on Thursdays, so that you are ready to participate in the review sessions.

If you are looking for more practice for a particulare module, you can work on the **extensions**. These extensions are entirely optional, but they are great practice!

Most things in this course (especially the studios) can be completed in small groups. We encourage you to form groups of 2 or 3 people to work on the exercises, assignments, and studios.

When you have completed a studio or an assignment, you must **demo** it to a TA or the instructor to recieve credit. The person who you demo your work to will ask you questions about your work, so be prepared! Upon successful completion of a demo, the instructor/TA will mark the studio or assignment as complete on [Vocareum](https://www.vocareum.com/). You may login to Vocareum to see what studios and assignments you have completed previously.

If you get stuck in class, be sure to ask a TA or the instructor! If you get stuck on something outside of class, we have set up a message board on [Piazza](https://www.piazza.com) that you can use to ask questions.

#Install the required programs

##Install eclipse

Watch [this video](../../../guides/installeclipse.mp4) for instructions on installing Eclipse.

##Access your repository

The first thing you will need to do is set up a [BitBucket](https://www.bitbucket.org). You should have received an email about this. If you have not, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

Once you have finished setting up your account on BitBucket, you need to create a clone of your repository on your local machine. First, go to the BitBucket page for your repository and copy the link:
![](../../../preps/15.png)

Next, open Eclipse and go into your workspace:

![](../../../preps/8.png)

Go to File -> Import. Then select Git project from the list:

![](../../../preps/9.png)

Next, select "Clone URI":

![](../../../preps/10.png)

Paste the link that you copied from BitBucket into the box at the top. Fill in your BitBucket login (not your WUSTL key!) at the bottom:

![](../../../preps/11.png)

Keep clicking next until you see the following screen. Make sure the box next to the CSE131 project is checked:

![](../../../preps/12.png)

Once you click "Finish", you should see the CSE131 project in your workspace. It should contain all of the materials for labs, studios, and extensions.
###Committing your work
Committing your work is equivalent to turning something in. When you are ready to submit your work, right click the project and select Team-> Commit:

![](../../../preps/13.png)

Type in a descriptive commit message then push the "Commit and Push" button at the bottom. Make sure to push! If you only commit (without the push) we will not be able to grade your work.


![](../../../preps/14.png)

You may commit/push as many times as you want. You should commit often! Think of it as saving your work.
###Updating your repository
From time to time we will add files to your repository (such as grades). To do this, you need to update your repository. This can be accomplished by right clicking the CSE131 project and selecting "Synchronize":

![](../../../preps/16.png)

This will get any changes that have been made to your repository. It is a good habit to run a synchronize before you make any changes to your repository, especially if you are working with a partner.
