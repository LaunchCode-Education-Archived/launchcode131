#Before you begin

Before you can begin on the exercises, studio, and assignment for this module, you must update your project to recieve the code. To do this, do the following:

1. Go to the BitBucket website. Find the page for your repository. On the right side you should see a message indicating that your repository is behind. Click *sync now*.

	If you do not see this message, **then you did not fork your repository correctly**. Go back to the prep work for module 0, and create a new fork for your repository.

2. Open Eclipse, find your project. Right click the name of your project and go to `Team -> Pull`.

3. On the window that pops up, enter your BitBucket password and click OK. You should now have the materials you need for module 4.

You will need to do this *at the beginning of each module* as we add more materials to the course.

#Exercise: Statistics for a list of numbers

##Part 1: Introduction

{% box 7srxyw1hb95mr15zmwkkgdn01dxw6clg %}
			   
##Part 2: The exercise


* Find and open the `Stats` Java program in the `exercises4` package
of the `exercises` source folder.

* Write code as directed to compute the specified statistics for the numbers
that you read in.

#Using Segdewick's graphics API

{% box 17s96l72w7fvihn1bz5s7sqiulguazag %}

#Exercise: Example using graphics

##Part 1: Introduction

{% box qpar2y6onsqknel1ywd1tbxre1a855os %}

##Part 2: The exercise


* Find and open the `GraphicsDemo` Java program in the `exercises4` package
of the `exercises` source folder.

* For each of the following, write code to generate the graphics as
specified, and run your program after each addition to see that you are
creating the right kinds of shapes, colors, and sizes.

	* Draw a blue point anywhere you like
	* Draw a larger green point someplace else
	* Draw an unfilled red triangle somewhere
	* Draw a filled yellow circle somewhere
	* Draw a filled blue rectangle somewhere

> The book does not include mention of Sedgewick's `filledRectangle` method.  But it is there, and you can find it by pausing after typing the `.`.  Eclipse will then show you possible completions, which will include
> `filledRectangle`.

#Exercise: Mouse and Keyboard

##Part 1: Introduction

{% box 7hk1tyoj1z2gn70z3gpr8fvvgn9u63et %}

##Part 2: The exercise


* Find and open the `WaitPoint` Java program in the `exercises4` package
of the `exercises` source folder.

* Write code that does the following:

	* Waits until the mouse has been pressed
	* Waits until the mouse has been released
	* Draws a visible point at the spot where the mouse was released
	* Waits until the user has typed a `q` (all other keys are ignored)
	* Writes text on the graphic screen that says goodbye

> Do this a step at a time, testing your code.  Look at the solution video 
> intermittently, as necessary.

#Achieving animation

{% box 2elm3p7r26jzo2z3cii99df2fu4odxhr %}

#Exercise: Example of animation

##Part 1: Introduction

{% box 4tkwpg7njcatdo6yw2by47z944aeabq4 %}

##Part 2: The Exercise


* Find and open the `MouseFollower` Java program in the `exercises4` package
of the `exercises` source folder.

* That code already contains the standard animation loop:

	* `StdDraw.clear()` at the beginning, to wipe the graphics
	display clean
	* Your code will then paint one frame of the animation
	* `StdDraw.show(10)` produces what you have drawn on the screen
	and waits 10 milliseconds before continuing.   


	By using `show(..)`,
	the drawing you do is not actually shown between calls to `show`. Instead, the drawing is done in memory, off the screen, which is much faster.

	When you call `show()`, the work you have done off screen is put
	on screen all at once. 

	The program also pauses for the specified time, usually
	10 to 50 milliseconds.  Pausing allows your computer to do something else
	for a while, which will make your computer feel more responsive in the
	other applications that are running.

* First try to get a ball on the screen to follow your mouse.  This
consists of reading the mouse's coordinates, and painting a ball at that
spot.

* When you have that working, try to think of how you could make the ball
appear to lag in its mouse-following activities.  


> As a hint, think about
> keeping some history of where the mouse has been. You can then have the
> ball go to locations in the mouse's past.

#Introduction to sound and music

#Exercise: Frequency of a pitch

##Part 1: Introduction

{% box x4fbx4088426m8h8pzi7d9imy1ifv9d9 %}

##Part 2: The exercise


* Find and open the `Pitches` Java program in the `exercises4` package
of the `exercises` source folder.

* Insert code to prompt the user to enter an integer representing a pitch.

* Compute the frequency that corresponds to that pitch.

* Print the frequency of that pitch, the frequency of a pitch 7 chromatic
steps higher, and the ratio of the two frequencies.


##Part 3: The Solution

{% box 97sgaa4tda5zjhnnkzph9qsf38sj3lug %}

#Exercise: Ratio of multiple pitches

##Part 1: Introduction

{% box su3gywwn5c07da333kpc3juc4ctu6v4y %}

##Part 2: The exercise


* Continue modifying the `Pitches` Java program in the `exercises4` package
of the `exercises` source folder.

* Prompt the user to enter an integer for pitch 1.

* Prompt the user to enter an integer for pitch 2.

* Compute the frequency that corresponds to those pitches

* Print the frequency of both pitches and the ratio of the two frequencies.
