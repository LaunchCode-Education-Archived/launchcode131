#Before you begin

Before you can begin on the exercises, studio, and assignment for this module, you must update your project to recieve the code. To do this, do the following:

1. Go to the BitBucket website. Find the page for your repository. On the right side you should see a message indicating that your repository is behind. Click *sync now*.

	If you do not see this message, **then you did not fork your repository correctly**. Go back to the prep work for module 0, and create a new fork for your repository.

2. Open Eclipse, find your project. Right click the name of your project and go to `Team -> Pull`.

3. On the window that pops up, enter your BitBucket password and click OK. You should now have the materials you need for module 4.

You will need to do this *at the beginning of each module* as we add more materials to the course.

#Module Overview

#Module Introduction

{% box v9osue0uqk5hwcktcvq2ybjz84vtqu5s %}

#Explicit Recursion

{% box szzizno3l9pkizf45tgk8s0k9lfa8nie %}

#Exercise: Recursive Factorial and Sum

##Part 1: Introduction

##Part 2: Demonstration of the debugger using factorial

{% box ureno6coqm13dscechi84o903xxcr040 %}

##Part 3: The Exercise


* In the `exercises6` package of the `exercises` source folder, create

	* `Sum.java` as a Java class
	
	* `SumTest.java` as a JUnit test file

* Complete both so that sum is computed as defined by the explicitly recursive formula:

	* sum(n) = sum(n-1) + n, if n &gt; 0
	
	* sum(n) = 0, otherwise

* Write some tests for sum and run the unit test file to make sure
your function works.

Remember that you have to have a `@Test` directive above any
unit test method, as shown in the video.



##Part 4: Solution

#Exercise: Recursive Factorial and Sum

##Part 1: The Exercise


* In the `exercises6` package of the `exercises` source folder, complete the

	* `Add.java`
	
	* `addTest.java`

* Complete both so that addition is computed as defined by the explicitly recursive formula:

	* add(x,y) = x, if y = 0
	* add(x,y) = add(x+1,y-1), otherwise

* Write some more tests for add and run the unit test file to make sure your function works.

Remember that you have to have a `@Test` directive above any
unit test method, as shown in the video.

* Under what conditions on x and y does your method operate correctly?

* How could you complete the `addAll(x,y)` method so it works for any `x` and `y`?

See the code, as a hint is given there.

#Exercise: Recursion and Base Cases

##Part 1: Introduction

##Part 2: The exercise


###Part 1

In the video, one possible explanation for human reproduction was given,
namely that a woman is born with all of the babies already inside her that
she would ever deliver.  This idea is attributed to
<a href="http://10e.devbio.com/article.php?id=65"> Anton von Leeuwenhoek</a> 
who, as a lensmaker, greatly advanced the use of microscopes in studying biology.
In terms of recursion and base cases, what is wrong with
von Leeuwenhoek's speculation?

###Part 2

* In the `exercises6` package of the `exercises` source folder, find and open the `FactorialNoBaseCase` class.

* Run the class as a Java Application.

* What happens, and why?

#Exercise: Generating graph paper

##Part 1: Introduction

{% box 4vd2t8a3covyplyisehv108gg5ali1ls %}

##Part 2: The exercise


* In the `exercises6` package of the `exercises` source folder, find and open the `GraphPaper` class.
  
* Complete the class so that it produces a grid on the screen

* Think about the recursive substructure of drawing a grid

* Think about the base case(s)
